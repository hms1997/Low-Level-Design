Step 1: Understanding the Requirements
We need to design a multi-level parking lot system with the following functionalities:

Multi-Level Structure: The system should support multiple levels, each containing parking slots.

vehicles.Vehicle Management: Vehicles can enter and exit the parking lot. The system should allocate and free parking spaces efficiently.

Slot Types: Parking slots should support different vehicle types (e.g., car, bike, truck).

Tracking Availability: The system should track available parking slots in real time.

Efficient Utilization: The system should prioritize optimal space usage while assigning slots.


Additional considerations:

Payment system (can be added later).
Reserved slots for disabled persons.
Entry and exit gates for handling traffic flow.


Step 2: Identifying Core Entities and Relationships
Based on the requirements, we can identify the following key entities:

ParkingLot (Manages multiple levels)
ParkingLevel (Manages multiple slots)
ParkingSlot (Represents an individual slot)
vehicles.Vehicle (Different types of vehicles)
ParkingTicket (Issued when a vehicle is parked)
ParkingAttendant (Handles parking assignments)

Relationships:
ParkingLot has multiple ParkingLevels (Composition).
ParkingLevel has multiple ParkingSlots (Aggregation).
ParkingSlot is assigned to a vehicles.Vehicle (Association).
ParkingTicket is linked to a vehicles.Vehicle (Association).
